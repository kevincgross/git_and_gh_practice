One of the biggest things motivating me to change my career is my personal expectations of myself. As selfish as it might sound, I know I am capable of having a life and future that I've always wanted. I know I have to work hard but I've had to work hard my whole life so this is just the next obstacle I have to climb. I want to be financially free enough that my family(in the future) will not have to worry about anything when it comes to that. I also have a goal that I want to retire before 45 if possible. That leaves me 20 years to put in as much work as I can, starting with Turing.
